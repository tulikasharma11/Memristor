## Introduction
A **Memristor (Memory Resistor)** is a two-terminal non-volatile electronic device whose resistance depends on the history of voltage and current. Memristors "remember" their resistance state even after the power is turned off, making them highly suitable for energy-efficient memory systems.

---

## Historical Background
- Concept introduced by **Leon Chua in 1971**.
- First practical device fabricated by **Stanley Williams and his team at HP Labs in 2008**.
- Recognized as the fourth basic circuit element alongside resistors, capacitors, and inductors.

---

## Circuit Involved
The memristor can be modeled as a simple two-terminal device where:
- Voltage (V) and current (I) have a non-linear relationship.
- The resistance changes based on the integral of the current (charge).

---

## VI Characteristics
- Exhibits a pinched hysteresis loop in the I-V curve.
- Behaves differently based on the applied voltage polarity and amplitude.
- Retains resistance state after the removal of voltage.

## Fabrication Techniques
1. **Sputtering Process:**
   - Bottom Electrode Deposition
   - Switching Layer Deposition
   - Top Electrode Deposition
   - Device Patterning
2. **3D Printing:**
   - Designing the layout
   - Slicing the design
   - Printing the device
   - Post-processing for functionality

- **Neuromorphic computing** (brain-like computing systems)
- **Flexible & wearable electronics**
- **Biological and medical systems**
- **Hardware security**

---

## Future Scope
- Energy-efficient, high-density storage solutions.
- Critical in **AI**, **neuromorphic hardware**, and **next-gen computing architectures**.
- Research is ongoing to overcome fabrication and integration challenges.
- Potential to bridge the gap between digital and analog computing.
